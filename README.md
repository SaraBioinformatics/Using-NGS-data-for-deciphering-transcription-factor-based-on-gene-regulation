# Using-NGS-data-for-deciphering-transcription-factor-based-on-gene-regulation
The availability of data produced from various sequencing platforms offer the possibility to answer complex questions in plant( Arabidopsis thaliana) research. However, drawbacks can arise when there are gaps in the information generated, and complementary platforms are essential to obtain more comprehensive data sets relating to specific biological process, such as responses to environmental perturbations in plant (Arabidopsis thaliana)systems. The investigation of transcriptional regulation raises different challenges, particularly in associating regulation by transcription factors with their downstream responsive genes. We discuss the integration of transcriptional factors (10 TF) studies through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We show how the data from ChIP-seq can strengthen information generated from RNA-seq in elucidating gene regulatory mechanisms. In particular, we discuss how integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data can help to unravel transcriptional gene regulation in plants using two different application of high throughput sequencing method.
