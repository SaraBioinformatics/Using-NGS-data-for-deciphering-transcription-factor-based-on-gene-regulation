# Using-NGS-data-for-deciphering-transcription-factor-based-on-gene-regulation
We show how the data from ChIP-seq can strengthen information generated from RNA-seq in elucidating gene regulatory mechanisms. In particular, we discuss how integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data can help to unravel transcriptional gene regulation in plants using two different application of high throughput sequencing method.
